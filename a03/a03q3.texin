{\bf Idea} This is similar to merge sort, except in the combining process we test both the left and right side, in order to decide which one is a majority.
\begin{magic}
We make the observation that if a box is {\bf not} the majority of the sublist, then it is {\bf not} the majority of the entire list.
\end{magic}
Suppose {\tt test(array,element)} is the function that decides whether two boxes have the same hidden number.
Consider the function {\tt majority} that returns the majority element.
\begin{algorithm}
majority A[1..n]
	if n = 1 then // 1 element in a 1-element set is a majority
		return A[n]
	end if

	// find candidates with merge-sort-like partitioning -- 2T(n/2)
	L = majority A[1..n/2]
	U = majority A[n/2+1..n]

	// n+n/2+n/4+... = O(n) in total
	Lc = count the number of times test(A,L) is true
	Uc = count the number of times test(A,U) is true

	if Lc <= n/2 or Uc <= n/2 then
		return NULL // assume test will return false for NULL
	else if Lc > Uc then
		return L
	else
		return U
	end if
\end{algorithm}
Then the function that we want is the following.
\begin{algorithm}
has_majority A[1..n]
	return (majority A) is not NULL
\end{algorithm}
The run time of {\tt has\_majority} is $\theta(T(majority))$, which has the same recurrence as merge sort.
Therefore, $T(n) \in \Theta(n \lg n)$
\done
