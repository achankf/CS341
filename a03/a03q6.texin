Let's prove it right away.
\begin{claim}
If all men have the same preference, and all women have the same preference, then the stable pairing is unique.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
Let's prove by induction.
Let $w_i$ be the $i$-th highest-ranked woman; similarly, let $m_i$ be the $i$-th highest-ranked man.

{\bf Base Case}
If $n = 1$, then $k=1$, so the only man will propose to the only woman.

{\bf Inductive Step}
Assume $(n-k)$ pairs have reached stability, for $k \le n$.
Suppose by way of contradiction that some men, $m$, will not propose to $w_k$.
That means those men will propose to the remaining $(k-1)$ women, which is impossible because all men have the same preference, and $w_k$ has higher preference than the remaining $(k-1)$ women; hence, a contradiction.
Therefore, all remaining men will propose to $w_k$.

Thus, $w_k$ will choose the highest-ranked available man, which is $m_k$.
So, we have the unique stable pairing $(m_k, w_k)$.
By induction, the stable pairings are, indeed, unique.
\end{proof}
As required.
